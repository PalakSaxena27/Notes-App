A modern and lightweight Notes Application built with React.js that allows users to create, copy, share, and save notes locally — directly in their browser.
Your notes remain safe and persistent even after closing the tab, thanks to Local Storage.

This app is ideal for quick note-taking, storing ideas, or managing daily tasks — all without any backend or login required.

🧠 Description

The React Notes App provides a seamless experience for users to create and manage notes efficiently.
